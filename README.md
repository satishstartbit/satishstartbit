💫 About Me:
Hi, I’m Bhoomika — a results-driven Full-Stack Developer with strong expertise in MERN stack, AWS services, and React Native, with a proven track record of delivering scalable web and mobile solutions.

I enjoy architecting end-to-end systems — from designing smooth, intuitive interfaces to building secure, high-performance APIs and deploying cloud-based infrastructures. My experience spans leading and developing large-scale ERP and logistics platforms where business impact and technical excellence go hand in hand.

Over the years, I’ve:

Designed and implemented complex multi-role applications for logistics and enterprise operations
Led feature development from concept to deployment while ensuring scalability and performance
Worked with modern stacks like Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, GraphQL, and Material UI
Collaborated cross-functionally to align technical solutions with real business needs
Contributed to architecture decisions and mentored developers to improve delivery standards

🧩 What I value:

Clean, reusable, and testable code
Efficient problem-solving with a focus on real-world impact
Staying agile and adaptable in fast-paced environments
Bridging the gap between technical capabilities and business goals
